# @santaklouse/p2p-netcat-core

**English** | [Русский](README.RU.md)

The interaction between the library, CLI, and browser Worker is documented in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/santaklouse/p2p-netcat-js/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

The browser-safe shared core of `p2p-netcat`. The package does not use Node.js
APIs and can be imported by the CLI, a Web Worker, and other JavaScript clients.

The package owns:

- logical ports and protocol IDs;
- PeerId and multiaddr normalization;
- relay address validation;
- Circuit Relay dial-plan construction;
- browser-compatible address detection;
- a shared transport preference order.

Creating a libp2p node, querying the DHT, Web Worker RPC, and stdin/stdout remain
in platform-specific packages.

## Exported API

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `validateService(value)` | Validates a logical port in the `1..65535` range |
| `protocolForService(service)` | Builds `/p2p-netcat/1.0.0/{service}` |
| `normalizePeerId(value)` | Validates and canonicalizes a PeerId |
| `normalizeMultiaddr(value)` | Validates and canonicalizes a multiaddr |
| `normalizeRelayAddress(value, options)` | Applies relay, WS/WSS, and secure-context checks |
| `relayedTargetAddress(relay, peerId, options)` | Returns the target Circuit Relay multiaddr |
| `createRelayDialPlan(input)` | Returns an immutable dial plan |
| `browserDialableAddress(address, options)` | Checks whether a browser can dial an address |
| `addressRank(address)` | Returns a numeric transport rank |
| `preferDialAddresses(a, b)` | Comparator for sorting multiaddrs |
| `trysteroRoomId(peerId, service)` | Builds the deterministic WebRTC room |
| `trysteroAuthPayload(...)` | Builds a domain-separated signed challenge |
| `encodeTrysteroAuthResponse(...)` | Encodes the public key and signature |
| `decodeTrysteroAuthResponse(...)` | Validates and decodes the response |
| `TrysteroStream` | Adapts an action channel to backpressure and EOF semantics |

The order is WebRTC Direct, QUIC v1, WebTransport, WSS, WS, TCP, other
addresses, and Circuit Relay. A transport appearing in the common ranking does
not imply that every runtime implements it.

The CLI and Web Worker use the library as a local npm dependency. The CLI path
is `file:packages/core`; the web project uses `file:../packages/core`.

Example of constructing a shared dial plan:

```js
import { createRelayDialPlan } from '@santaklouse/p2p-netcat-core'

const plan = createRelayDialPlan({
  peerId: '12D3KooWQ3uxpHgjDKE6vGmvzKS8RPbxUDLwJ7XCLaD6YXdUfbR9',
  service: 31337,
  relay: '/dns4/relay.example/tcp/443/wss/p2p/12D3KooWEqeQRAJ61HSv9yMPk8yzjke7NxmTFcvFt4GzwXxzVjXW',
  requireWebSocket: true,
  secureContext: true
})

console.log(plan.destination)
console.log(plan.protocol)
```
