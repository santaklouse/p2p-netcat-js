# p2p-netcat web

**English** | [Русский](README.RU.md)

The complete interaction between the core package, CLI, browser discovery, and
secure stream is documented in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

A fully static browser client for `p2p-netcat`. The project has no SSR, API
routes, database, or server-side scripts. Its production build contains only
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a Web Worker, a Service Worker, a manifest, and images.

## Features

- connection to a CLI server by `PeerId` and logical port;
- automatic lookup through HTTP Delegated Routing and IPFS Amino DHT;
- direct Trystero/WebRTC fallback through public WebTorrent trackers;
- WebTransport or WebSocket/WSS through libp2p Circuit Relay v2;
- an optional manual relay multiaddr as an emergency override;
- Noise encryption and Yamux inside a dedicated Web Worker;
- a terminal widget for text and binary output;
- text, file, and EOF sending, plus received-byte download;
- an installable PWA with offline UI caching and Service Worker auto-update;
- responsive desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts.

## Architecture

The Web Worker imports the browser-safe
[`@santaklouse/p2p-netcat-core`](../packages/core) package also used by the CLI.
Protocol IDs, PeerId and logical-port validation, WS/WSS rules, and Circuit
Relay dial-plan construction are shared. Delegated Routing, the DHT client,
libp2p WebTransport/WebSocket transports, Trystero/WebRTC, Worker messaging,
the terminal UI, and the PWA/Service Worker remain in the web project. This
architecture runs no server-side JavaScript.

When the relay field is empty, Trystero/WebRTC and the Worker start
simultaneously. The Worker resolves the PeerId through
`https://delegated-ipfs.dev/routing/v1` and then uses DHT as a fallback. The
first authenticated channel wins. A successful libp2p route is cached in
IndexedDB for 24 hours. The WebRTC server proves the entered PeerId with a
signed Ed25519 challenge. `public/network-config.json` can add compatible routing
endpoints and a hidden WSS relay pool without changing the UI:

```json
{
  "delegatedRouting": [
    "https://delegated-ipfs.dev/routing/v1"
  ],
  "relays": []
}
```

The `.npmrc` file enables `install-links=true`. This copies the local package
into `node_modules` during `npm ci`, so a clean GitHub Actions build does not
depend on packages previously installed at the repository root.

## Installation and build

Node.js 22.13 or newer is required.

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run lint
npm run build
```

The complete standalone static output is written to `web/dist`. It can be
deployed to any HTTPS static-file host; the application does not need a backend.

For development:

```bash
cd web
npm run dev
```

## GitHub Pages

The repository already contains `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. It checks
TypeScript, builds only the `web` directory, derives the Vite base path from the
GitHub repository name, and publishes `web/dist`.

After pushing the repository, open **Settings → Pages** and select
**Build and deployment → Source → GitHub Actions**. The next push to `main`
publishes the page automatically. For `santaklouse/p2p-netcat-js`, the expected
URL is:

```text
https://santaklouse.github.io/p2p-netcat-js/
```

GitHub Pages supplies HTTPS, allowing the Service Worker, PWA installation,
Delegated Routing, WebRTC, and secure WSS/WebTransport routes to work.

## Verifiable manual relay route

The relay field is optional. This example tests the explicit fallback locally
when automatic discovery cannot use the CLI server's TCP/QUIC address.

Start a relay with a separate WebSocket port in the first terminal:

```bash
p2p-nc relay -4 -p 9090 --websocket-port 9091
```

Copy the printed address containing `/tcp/9091/ws/p2p/`. Start the server in a
second terminal and pass that address through `--relay`:

```bash
p2p-nc -l 31337 --relay /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9091/ws/p2p/12D3KooWEqeQRAJ61HSv9yMPk8yzjke7NxmTFcvFt4GzwXxzVjXW
```

Enter the server PeerId and logical port `31337` in the web UI. Then expand
“Additional relay” and enter the same WebSocket relay multiaddr.

The PeerId in the command above belongs to a development test key. A normal
relay run prints a different PeerId—always use the complete address that your
running relay actually prints.

## HTTPS, WSS, and running without a backend

Service Workers and PWA installation require a secure context: HTTPS or
`localhost`. Opening `dist/index.html` through `file://` is therefore not a
supported browser mode. This is a browser security restriction, not a need for
application server logic.

An `http://*.github.io` URL is automatically replaced with its `https://`
equivalent before the application starts. This is required for Web Crypto,
WebRTC, and Service Workers. If another static host serves the page over plain
HTTP, the network worker stops with an explicit HTTPS diagnostic.

When a manual relay is used from an HTTPS page, it must be available through
WSS. TLS normally terminates at a static reverse proxy or CDN that forwards
WebSocket traffic to port `9091`. The public multiaddr then has this form:

```text
/dns4/p2p.example.com/tcp/443/wss/p2p/12D3KooWEqeQRAJ61HSv9yMPk8yzjke7NxmTFcvFt4GzwXxzVjXW
```

The web application itself accepts no HTTP requests and executes no server
code. After the first load, the UI shell is available offline. A P2P session
still requires network access and at least one browser-dialable route.

## Verification

```bash
cd web
npm test
npm run lint
```
